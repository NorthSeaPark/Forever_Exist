# Alpha and Beta

- Alpha and Beta are two different parts of an equation used to explain the performance of stocks and investment funds.

- Beta is a measure of volatility relative to a benchmark.

- Alpha is the excess return on an investment after adjusting for market-related volatility and random fluctuations.

- Alpha and beta are both measures used to compare and predict returns

- $$
  y = a + bx + u
  $$

   y is the performance of the stock or fund

   a is alpha --- the excess return of the stock or fund

   b is beta --- volatility relative to the benchmark

   x is the performance of the benchmark

   u is the residual, unexplained random portion of performance in a given year.

- A fund with lots of growth stocks and high beta will usually beat the market during a good year for stocks. Similarly, a conservative fund that holds bonds will have a low beta and typically outperform the S&P 500 during a poor year for the market.
